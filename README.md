# polar function animation / visualizer 

canvas app to visualize the drawing of polar functions / calculation of integrals of polar functions.  
  
the keypress button is "Enter"  

dtheta and keypress_dtheta are different; dtheta is the calculation and keypress_dtheta is how much it renders at once.  
making them equal will make a one keypress do one calculation  

there are only 4 functions but they can be added pretty easily at the top of script.js  

to run it just open index.html with your favorite browser.  
actually, it apparently does not work on safari (webkit based browsers?)
